              <p>
                Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The
                Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know
                about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
                constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about
                the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
              </p>

                traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the
                planets in our solar system.

              <h3>Discover the Origins of Life</h3>
              <p>
                For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
                question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
                here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
                framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
                know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to
                meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly
                Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

              <h3>The History of Medicine</h3>
              <p>
                From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
                biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
                the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer
                and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
                understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
                history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
                including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
                transplant.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the
                lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow
                creatures have beat us to it

                As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
                planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to
                create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole
                planet.

                In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we
                currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and
                pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
                contribute to a brighter future.
